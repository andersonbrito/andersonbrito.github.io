intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I am a virologist who develops and uses computational tools to study molecular evolution. I hold a BSc degree (Hons) in Biological Sciences from the University of Brasília (UnB), and a MSc in Microbiology from the University of São Paulo (USP).<br><br>Currently I am a last year PhD student in Computational Biology supervised by [Dr John Pinney](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.pinney) in the [Theoretical Systems Biology Group](http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/people/) at Imperial College London. My Bioinformatics research focuses on multiple aspects of Molecular Evolution, integrating Phylogenetics, Genomics and Structural Biology data to better understand the evolution of viruses from a systemic perspective.
