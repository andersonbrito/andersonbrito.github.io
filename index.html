intro: 
  - excerpt: 'I am a virologist who develops and uses computational tools to study molecular evolution. I hold a BSc degree (Hons) in Biological Sciences from the University of Brasília (UnB), a MSc in Microbiology from the University of São Paulo (USP), and a PhD in Computational Biology from Imperial College London.<br><br>Currently I am a postdoctoral associate at the [Yale School of Public Health](https://publichealth.yale.edu/), based at [Grubaugh Lab](http://grubaughlab.com/team/), investigating mosquito-borne viruses emergence, transmission, and evolution. My research focuses on multiple aspects of Molecular Evolution, integrating Phylogenetics, Genomics and Structural Biology data to better understand the evolution of viruses from a systemic perspective.
