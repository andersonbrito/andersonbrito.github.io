intro: 
  - excerpt: 'My name is Anderson Brito, and I am a virologist developing and applying computational tools to study molecular evolution. I hold a BSc degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Brasília (UnB), and a MSc in Microbiology from the University of São Paulo (USP), both in Brazil. Currently I am a last year PhD student in Computational Biology based in the [Theoretical Systems Biology Group](http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/people/) at Imperial College London. My Bioinformatics research focuses on multiple aspects of Molecular Evolution, integrating Phylogenetics, Genomics and Structural Biology data to better understand the evolution of pathogens from a systemic perpective.'
